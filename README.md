**Algorithm Challenge – Level 3 | #47**
**Add Clients Data to File (C++)**

**🧮 Problem Description**
--
This challenge focuses on storing structured client data permanently inside a text file.

Instead of keeping data only in memory, the program automatically appends each client record to a document using file handling techniques.

**💡 Core Programming Concept**
-
Data Persistence & Serialization
Converting structured data into text format and saving it automatically.

**🧩 How the Algorithm Works**
--
Client data is entered through the program.

The record is serialized into a single text line.

The program opens the file in append mode.

The data is added automatically to the end of the file.

The file is created if it does not already exist.

**📂 Important File Behavior Note**
-

⚠️ The file is opened and managed **automatically by the program**.
The user does not need to open the document manually.

New records are appended automatically

Existing data is preserved

The file is created automatically if missing

📌 The file exists on **my local machine**, and behavior may differ depending on:

Operating system

File location

File permissions
